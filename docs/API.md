# API

The field-level contract is the OpenAPI document. This page is the route
map. Command equivalents are in [CLI](CLI.md). Sample curls are in
[examples.sh](examples.sh).

| Document | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Spec source | `openapi/spec.yaml` |
| Scalar UI | `GET /docs` |
| Spec JSON | `GET /openapi` |
| Spec YAML | `GET /docs/openapi.yaml` |

`just docs` prints those URLs for a server on port 8080.

## Who can call what

`/api` management routes and `/ciba` need `Authorization: Bearer` with a
client-credentials token whose scope contains `management`. `oauth-cli
init` writes that client into `management.client_id` and
`management.client_secret`. The server inserts the client on startup
when the id is missing.

A user access token calls `/api/me`. It cannot call the management
routes. Dynamic registration drops the `management` scope. A
client-credentials request can only receive scopes already stored on
the client.

Public account routes are `POST /api/account/register`,
`POST /api/account/password/forgot`, `POST /api/account/password/reset`,
and `POST /api/account/email/verify`.

`GET /health` needs no token.

AAuth discovery is separate from these routes. It is off unless
`aauth.enabled` is true. See [AAuth](AAUTH.md).

## OAuth and OIDC

| Method | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET, POST | `/oauth/authorize` | Authorization endpoint |
| GET | `/oauth/oob` | Combined-code helper |
| POST | `/oauth/token` | Token endpoint |
| POST | `/oauth/revoke` | Revoke a token (RFC 7009) |
| POST | `/oauth/introspect` | Introspect a token (RFC 7662) |
| POST | `/oauth/register` | Dynamic client registration |
| POST | `/oauth/device` | Device authorization |
| POST | `/oauth/par` | Pushed authorization request |
| POST | `/oauth/bc-authorize` | CIBA backchannel authentication |
| GET, POST | `/oauth/logout` | RP-initiated logout |
| GET | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` | OIDC discovery |
| GET | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | Authorization server metadata |
| GET | `/oidc/jwks` | Signing keys |
| GET | `/oidc/userinfo` | UserInfo |

`POST /oauth/token` accepts these `grant_type` values when the client
allows them:

| Grant | `grant_type` |
| --- | --- |
| Authorization code | `authorization_code` |
| Client credentials | `client_credentials` |
| Refresh | `refresh_token` |
| Device code | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` |
| CIBA | `urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba` |
| Token exchange | `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` |
| Password | `password` |

The default discovery list includes every grant above except `password`.
`oauth-cli client master` creates a client that includes `password`.
The password grant sends the identifier in `username`. CIBA on this
server is poll mode.

A client can register `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` or
`urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob:auto` instead of an HTTP callback. The request
must use `response_type=code` and PKCE `S256`. After sign-in the server
returns an HTML page that shows the code. The token request sends that
same `redirect_uri` with the pasted code and `code_verifier`. `oauth-cli
flow paste` prints the URL and reads the code.

When `security.oob_helper` is true, `GET /oauth/oob` is the helper page
from draft-richer-oauth-oob-authcode. Register that URL as a normal
redirect URI. The authorization response is still a redirect, with `code`
and `state` on the query string. The page shows one combined value. The
draft names an HKDF info parameter and does not assign its bytes. This
server uses the ASCII string `draft-richer-oauth-oob-authcode`. With the
flag off, the path returns 404.

An authorization request may include `requested_actor`, the client id
of an agent registered on this server. That request requires PKCE
`S256`. The consent screen names the agent and is shown on every such
request. The token request then includes `actor_token`, an access token
this server already issued to that agent. The access token is a JWT
(`typ` `at+jwt`) even when the server default is opaque. `sub` is the
user, `aud` is the resource or the issuer, `client_id` and `azp` are the
calling client, and `act` is `{"sub":"<agent client id>"}`. A code
without `requested_actor` rejects `actor_token`.

JWT access tokens from every grant use that same profile. `aud` is the
`resource` parameter when the request sends one, and the issuer
otherwise.

`POST /oauth/introspect` is for confidential clients. A client sees its
own tokens, tokens whose resource is that client, or every token when
it is the management client. Anyone else gets `{"active":false}`.

Authorize `response_type`:

| Response type | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `code` | Authorization code |
| `token` | Access token |
| `id_token` | ID token |
| `code id_token` | Code and ID token |
| `code token` | Code and access token |
| `code id_token token` | All three |
| `id_token token` | ID token and access token |
| `none` | No token, `state` only |

ID tokens and UserInfo are signed. They are encrypted as a nested JWE
only when the client sets the encryption algorithms and publishes an
RSA key. Access tokens stay unencrypted. A client with `subject_type:
pairwise` receives a sector subject. See [Configuration](CONFIG.md).

## Browser

| Method | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET, POST | `/login` | Password form |
| POST | `/login/mfa` | TOTP step |
| GET | `/login/social/{id}` | Start social login |
| GET | `/login/social/{id}/callback` | Finish social login |
| GET, POST | `/register` | Self-service signup |
| GET, POST | `/consent` | Consent |
| GET, POST | `/organization` | Choose an organization |
| GET, POST | `/forgot`, `/reset` | Password reset pages |
| GET | `/verify-email` | Email confirmation page |
| GET, POST | `/device` | Device-code approval |
| GET | `/mfa/enroll` | TOTP enrollment |
| POST | `/mfa/enroll/verify` | Confirm enrollment |
| GET | `/branding/assets/{name}` | One branding file |

`/organization` appears when organizations are on, the request did not
name one, and the user has more than one membership. See
[Configuration](CONFIG.md).

## Account API

User token:

```
GET    /api/me
PATCH  /api/me
POST   /api/me/password
POST   /api/me/email/send
GET    /api/me/sessions
DELETE /api/me/sessions/{sid}
GET    /api/me/refresh-tokens
DELETE /api/me/refresh-tokens/{id}
GET    /api/me/activity
GET    /api/me/login-analytics?window=720h
```

`window` is a Go duration. The default is 30 days (`720h`).

## Management API

Clients, users, and tokens:

```
GET    /api/clients
POST   /api/clients
GET    /api/clients/{id}
PUT    /api/clients/{id}
DELETE /api/clients/{id}

GET    /api/users
POST   /api/users
GET    /api/users/{id}
PATCH  /api/users/{id}
POST   /api/users/{id}/password
POST   /api/users/{id}/mfa/enable
POST   /api/users/{id}/mfa/verify
GET    /api/users/{id}/mfa/status
POST   /api/users/{id}/mfa/disable
GET    /api/users/{id}/sessions
DELETE /api/users/{id}/sessions/{sid}
GET    /api/users/{id}/activity
GET    /api/users/{id}/login-analytics

GET    /api/tokens
POST   /api/tokens/{token}/revoke
GET    /api/refresh-tokens
POST   /api/refresh-tokens/{id}/revoke
```

Refresh-token lists use the public id and omit the secret.

Scopes, resources, and consents:

```
GET    /api/scopes
POST   /api/scopes
GET    /api/scopes/{name}
DELETE /api/scopes/{name}

GET    /api/resources
POST   /api/resources
GET    /api/resources/{uri}
PUT    /api/resources/{uri}
DELETE /api/resources/{uri}
GET    /api/resources/{uri}/scopes

GET    /api/consents
DELETE /api/consents
```

Organizations, webhooks, audit, analytics, CIBA, and keys:

```
GET    /api/orgs
POST   /api/orgs
GET    /api/orgs/{orgID}
POST   /api/orgs/{orgID}/domains
POST   /api/orgs/{orgID}/members

GET    /api/webhooks
POST   /api/webhooks
GET    /api/webhooks/{id}
PATCH  /api/webhooks/{id}
DELETE /api/webhooks/{id}
POST   /api/webhooks/{id}/test

GET    /api/audit
GET    /api/analytics/logins
POST   /api/keys/rotate

GET    /api/ciba/pending
POST   /api/ciba/{id}/approve
POST   /api/ciba/{id}/deny
```

`oauth-mobile` calls `GET /ciba/pending`, `POST /ciba/approve`, and
`POST /ciba/deny`. Its `status` command calls `GET /health`.

Webhook deliveries are `POST` JSON. `X-Webhook-Signature` is `sha256=`
plus the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the timestamp, a dot, and the raw body, using
the webhook secret.
`X-Webhook-Timestamp` is the unix time. `X-Webhook-Event` is the event
name. `*` subscribes to every event. Events include `login`,
`login_failed`, `logout`, `sso_session_triggered`,
`bruteforce_detected`, `forgot_password`, `change_password`,
`password_reset`, `user_registered`, `email_verified`, and
`user_disabled`. A delivery error is logged and does not fail the user
action. `POST /api/webhooks/{id}/test` sends `webhook.test`.

`POST /api/keys/rotate` returns the new key ids. Private keys stay in
SQL. See [Infrastructure](INFRA.md).

## Errors

Protocol errors use the OAuth shape:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "error_description": "what went wrong"
}
```

The OpenAPI document lists status codes per route.
