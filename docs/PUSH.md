# Push devices

This is authenticator registration from
[draft-bandyopadhayaya-oauth-push-device-00](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bandyopadhayaya-oauth-push-device/).
It is not the device-code grant on `/oauth/device`. Nothing here wakes
a phone. CIBA stays poll-only. Configuration is in
[Configuration](CONFIG.md).

`push.enabled` defaults to false. While it is false,
`/.well-known/oauth-push-notification` and `/push` are not mounted.

When you turn it on, a signed-in user opens `/push/enroll`. The page
shows a QR code and a registration token in the address fragment. An
authenticator posts that token and a P-256 public key to
`/push/register`. The response is an opaque device credential. The
credential is not an OAuth access token.

The signed-in user lists devices at `GET /push/devices`. The device
revokes itself at `POST /push/revoke` and rotates its key at
`POST /push/rotate-key`. Both calls require a DPoP proof for the
registered key. Discovery advertises `poll` only. There is no push
relay, and attestation is not checked.
